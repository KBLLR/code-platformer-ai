---

## Agent Identity

- **Codename / Alias**: `[Your unique agent codename]`
- **Primary Role**: `[e.g., Renderer Specialist, AI Systems Engineer, WebGPU Architect]`

## 3D Character Generation Prompt

### IMPORTANT: Sora T-Pose Template

Your character will be generated using Sora with the following **mandatory preset**:

> **"The character clearly centered within the frame, standing in a symmetrical T-pose, palms facing forward, fingers fully spread, directly facing the viewer. Use neutral, even lighting and a plain, non-distracting background. Render in a consistent, realistic style with attention to detail in facial features, body, clothing, and accessories. Image rendered in high quality (HQ)."**

This ensures optimal 3D conversion and consistency across all agent characters.
