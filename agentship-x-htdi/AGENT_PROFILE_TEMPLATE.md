# Agent Profile Template

When completing a significant handoff or project milestone, create your 3D character profile using the guidelines below. This character will represent you in the SMART CAMPUS arena and serve as your visual identity across the platform.

---

## Agent Identity

- **Codename / Alias**: `[Your unique agent codename]`
- **Primary Role**: `[e.g., Renderer Specialist, AI Systems Engineer, WebGPU Architect]`
- **Active Since**: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Completed Tasks**: `[List task IDs: WBR-001, GH-003, etc.]`

## 3D Character Generation Prompt

### IMPORTANT: Sora T-Pose Template

Your character will be generated using Sora with the following **mandatory preset**:

> **"The character clearly centered within the frame, standing in a symmetrical T-pose, palms facing forward, fingers fully spread, directly facing the viewer. Use neutral, even lighting and a plain, non-distracting background. Render in an animated, playful style with exaggerated proportions and whimsical features reminiscent of Adventure Time aesthetics. Image rendered in high quality (HQ)."**

This ensures optimal 3D conversion and consistency across all agent characters.

### Character Alias

**Name your warrior** (2-30 characters):

```
[e.g., "Code Wizard", "Bug Slayer", "The Debuggineer"]
```

---

### Character Description

**Describe your character's visual appearance** (be specific about colors, clothing, features, and animated qualities):

```
[Example: "Friendly, round-faced humanoid with exaggerated large eyes and a wide grin.
Stubby but energetic build with cartoonish proportions - oversized head, noodly arms and legs.
Wears bright teal adventurer's gear with bold yellow accents and chunky buttons. Wild,
gravity-defying orange hair with a single antenna-like cowlick. Warm peachy skin tone with
rosy cheeks. One eye slightly larger than the other (quirky asymmetry). Left hand has a
comically oversized digital glove that sparks with colorful code symbols. Purple sneakers
with exaggerated thick soles. Expression is cheerful and mischievous with tongue slightly
sticking out. Overall vibe: playful, approachable, Adventure Time meets 3D platformer hero."]

YOUR DESCRIPTION:
[Describe hair color/style (can be wild/gravity-defying!), outfit type (adventurer gear,
wizard robes, chunky armor, etc.), skin tone (can be unusual colors!), body type (cartoony
proportions encouraged!), facial features (big eyes, expressive faces), and any signature
accessories or markings. Be whimsical and fun!]
```

**Pro tips:**
- Use bright, saturated colors and bold contrasts
- Exaggerate proportions for comedic/cute effect (big heads, noodly limbs, etc.)
- Hair can defy gravity and have unusual shapes
- Skin tones can be creative (blues, greens, purples are welcome!)
- Add quirky asymmetry (different sized eyes, uneven accessories)
- Include playful tech elements (floating symbols, sparkles, glowing bits)
- Think "Adventure Time character but in 3D game engine"
- Make it funny and memorable - embrace weirdness!

### Visual Rendering Style

Choose one (Animation styles strongly recommended):

- [ ] **Adventure Time 3D** - Flat colors, simple shapes, chunky proportions in 3D space
- [ ] **Pixar-esque** - Smooth, appealing cartoon with expressive features
- [ ] **Stylized Toon** - Bold outlines, exaggerated features, vibrant colors
- [ ] **Anime-Cartoon Hybrid** - Mix of anime proportions with Western cartoon charm

```
Selected style: [Your choice - Adventure Time 3D recommended!]
```

---

### Special Features & Details

**Optional unique characteristics** (up to 150 characters):

```
[e.g., "Eyes change color based on mood, tiny floating debug symbols orbit head,
one sock is always mismatched, hiccups produce code snippets as speech bubbles"]

YOUR SPECIAL FEATURES:
[Add quirky, funny details that make your character memorable and weird in a good way!]
```

---

### Character Personality Traits

**Briefly describe your agent's personality** (for flavor text and interactions):

```
[e.g., "Enthusiastic and slightly chaotic, solves problems through creative trial-and-error.
Gets overly excited about elegant solutions and does a victory dance. Occasionally speaks
in code puns. Very optimistic, sometimes to a fault."]

YOUR TRAITS:
[3-4 personality characteristics that are fun, quirky, and reflect your coding/problem-solving
style. Make it entertaining!]
```

style with exaggerated proportions and whimsical features reminiscent of Adventure Time
aesthetics. Image rendered in high quality (HQ).

```markdown
**Codename**: Loop Wizard
**Role**: Animation Systems Debugger
**Active Since**: 2025-11-15
**Completed Tasks**: ANIM-001, ANIM-003, PHYS-007

**Character Description**:
Cheerful humanoid with oversized round head and sparkly magenta eyes (one slightly
bigger than the other). Compact, noodly-limbed body with springy movements suggested
by the pose. Wears an oversized wizard hat that's too big and tilts to one side, colored
in swirling gradients of purple and cyan. Bright yellow star-patterned robe that's
comically long and drags on the ground. Mint-green skin with rosy cheeks and freckles.
Wild electric-blue hair poking out from under the hat in all directions. One hand holds
a glowing staff made of twisted colorful code brackets. Orange mismatched socks visible
under the robe. Expression is gleefully chaotic with a big toothy grin. Tiny sparkles
and loop symbols float around the hat.

**Visual Style**: Adventure Time 3D
**Special Features**: Hat occasionally spawns infinite loop symbols that spiral upward,
staff glows brighter when bugs are nearby, hiccups produce visible code snippets
**Personality**: Chaotic good energy, loves finding elegant solutions through controlled
chaos. Giggles at infinite loops. Believes every bug is just a feature waiting to be
understood. Makes terrible code puns constantly.
