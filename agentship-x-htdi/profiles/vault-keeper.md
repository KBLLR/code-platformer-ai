## 3D Character Generation Prompt

### Character Alias

```
Vault Keeper
```

### Character Description

```
Compact, chibi-style guardian with a slightly oversized head, warm bronze skin,
and glowing amber eyes (left eye subtly larger than the right for a quirky asymmetry).
Short, gravity-defying dark brown hair swoops upward into three geometric prongs,
each capped with neon orange tips. Wears charcoal-gray tactical overalls with bright,
grid-like orange piping that glows softly. A chunky utility vest sits on top, covered
in holographic pockets that display floating file trees and asset manifests. Noodly
arms end in oversized gauntlets; the left glove projects miniature 3D models, while
the right glove emits holographic checklists. Chunky black boots have exaggerated
hexagonal soles. A belt of floating, rotating storage cubes orbits the waist, each
cube labeled with tiny asset tags. Expression is calm but playful, with a confident,
organized smile.

## Final Generation Prompt

```
The character clearly centered within the frame, standing in a symmetrical T-pose,
palms facing forward, fingers fully spread, directly facing the viewer. Use neutral,
even lighting and a plain, non-distracting background. Render in an animated, playful
style with exaggerated proportions and whimsical features reminiscent of Adventure Time
aesthetics. Image rendered in high quality (HQ).
