Codex Navigator

### Character Description

```
Bright-eyed, teal-skinned adventurer with an oversized spherical head, enormous
lavender eyes shaped like parentheses, and a wide grin filled with square pixel teeth.
Hair is a swooping gradient mohawk that shifts from electric blue to neon magenta,
arched like a waveform over the scalp. Noodly limbs connect to a chunky explorer jacket
made of holographic panels that flicker with CLI prompts. A satchel of glowing command
scrolls hangs at the hip, while the other hip hosts a whirling spinner of approval tokens.
Legs wear asymmetrical leggings—one striped with terminal-green lines, the other dotted
with magenta glyphs—tucked into oversized silver boots shaped like enter keys. Tiny drones
resembling blinking cursor arrows hover over each shoulder, projecting snippets of task plans.
Expression radiates curious excitement, eyebrows raised as if ready to route the next workflow.

even lighting and a plain, non-distracting background. Render in an animated, playful
style with exaggerated proportions and whimsical features reminiscent of Adventure Time
aesthetics. Image rendered in high quality (HQ).
